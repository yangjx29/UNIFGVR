Otherwise, there might be something wrong with your environment. Did you have `libjpeg` or `libpng` installed before building `torchvision` from source?
  warn(
Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.

The image processor of type `Qwen2VLImageProcessor` is now loaded as a fast processor by default, even if the model checkpoint was saved with a slow processor. This is a breaking change and may produce slightly different outputs. To continue using the slow processor, instantiate this class with `use_fast=False`. Note that this behavior will be extended to all models in a future release.
`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of dog in the dog category. 
 description: The dog in the picture appears to be a small breed with long, shaggy fur that is matted and covered in dried mud and leaves. The fur on its head looks particularly matted and fluffy, resembling a mop. Its tail is raised, and it has a playful, energetic demeanor despite being muddy. The ground is covered with fallen leaves, suggesting the dog may have been playing or digging in the mud nearby.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of brown-fur in the dog category. 
 description: The animal in the picture appears to be a dhole (Canis dingo), also known as the dhole or dhole dog. It has distinct reddish-brown fur with a lighter underbelly and legs, which is characteristic of this species. The dhole's coat is short and smooth, and it has a slender build compared to other canines. Its ears are large and pointed, alerting us to its keen senses. The background suggests a forested area, typical of where these animals roam freely.

If you're identifying animals, the reddish-brown coloration and the size and shape of the body and head are key features that help differentiate between a fox and a dhole. Foxes tend to have more reddish-orange coats but often with a more fox-like face and tail.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of pointed-ears in the dog category. 
 description: The animal in the picture appears to be a dhole (also known as the dingo or wild dog), identifiable by its slender build and pointed ears, which are characteristic features of this species. The dhole's coat is reddish-brown with a lighter underbelly, and it has a bushy tail that tapers to a point—a trait shared with foxes but more pronounced here. Its ears are large, erect, and rounded at the tips, which helps amplify hearing—an important adaptation for a predator. The surrounding environment, with grass, trees, and scattered pine cones, suggests a woodland habitat typical of where these animals roam.

If you're identifying wildlife, it's crucial to ensure accuracy. The animal depicted resembles a dhole, also known scientifically as Canis dingo, which is native to South and Southeast Asia. However, distinguishing between closely related species like wolves, foxes, and dogs can sometimes be challenging without expert knowledge or additional context clues such as size, body proportions, or geographic location.

Snow blankets the ground, and the branches of trees closest to the camera droop heavily under the weight of ice and snow, creating a picturesque, frosty ambiance. The overall color palette of the scene leans toward cool, icy hues, emphasizing the crisp, chilly nature of this winter day.

 description: The animal in the picture is not a dog but rather a wild dog, specifically an African painted dog (also known as the painted wolf or wild dog). It has distinctive markings that include a mix of black, white, and tan fur with irregular patches of color. The coat is mottled, with areas of dark brown, black, and white, giving it a unique and striking appearance. Its ears are large and pointed, alert to its surroundings. The ground appears dry and dusty, suggesting a savanna-like or semi-arid habitat, which aligns with the natural environment of this species.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of large pointed ears in the dog category. 
 description: The animal in the picture is not a dog but rather a wild dog, specifically an African painted dog (also known as the painted wolf or wild dog). Its visual attributes include:

1. **Coloration and Markings**: The animal has a distinctive coat with a mix of black, white, and tan fur, which is typical for African painted dogs. The pattern is unique to each individual.

2. **Ears**: It has upright, rounded ears that are characteristic of the species, often appearing more "dog-like" than those of wolves.

3. **Size and Build**: While it may share some physical traits with domestic dogs, its body structure and proportions resemble that of a medium-sized wild canine, such as a wolf or a jackal.

4. **Setting**: The background suggests a naturalistic habitat, possibly a zoo or wildlife reserve, characterized by dry soil, sparse vegetation, and a tree trunk partially visible in the background.

These features collectively indicate this is likely an African painted dog, a wild canid species native to Africa.

 description: The dog in the picture appears to be a Bloodhound, identifiable by its droopy ears and muscular build. The floppy ears suggest it's a mature adult, as puppies typically have tighter, more upright ears. The floppy ears also indicate that this is likely a male dog, as intact males (neutered) often carry floppy ears, which contrasts with bitches who tend to have perked-up ears after estrus. The floppy ears complement the dog's calm demeanor and the urban, somewhat chilly backdrop.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of wiry-haired in the dog category. 
 description: The dog in the picture appears to be a Wirehaired Fox Terrier (also known as a Wire Fox Terrier). Its fur is thick and wiry, with a mix of light and dark shades, predominantly brownish-red with darker, almost black, patches on its back. The coat looks shaggy and well-groomed, covering not just the body but also the face, which has a distinctive beard-like growth around the muzzle. The dog's posture suggests relaxation or perhaps mild discomfort, as it seems to be lying down comfortably yet with a slightly tense or unhappy expression. The background includes grass, some fallen leaves, and part of what looks like a paved path, indicating this photo might have been taken outdoors in a park or garden setting.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of black_fur_on_face in the dog category. 
 description: The dog in the picture has predominantly black fur with some white markings on its chest and muzzle. Its face is expressive, with dark, soulful eyes and a slightly open mouth showing a pink tongue. The fur appears thick and somewhat unkempt, giving it a charming, shaggy look. A small, triangular, light-colored tag is visible hanging from around its neck. The background includes a window with sheer curtains, allowing sunlight to illuminate the scene, and part of a patterned yellow cushion can be seen behind the dog.

 description: The dog in the picture has predominantly black fur with some white markings on its underside and legs. The fur appears fluffy and somewhat unkempt, giving it a charming, scruffy look. There is a small, triangular-shaped tag attached to its collar, which seems to be metallic or reflective. The background includes a window with sheer curtains, allowing sunlight to filter through, creating a bright and airy atmosphere indoors.

 description: The image shows two dogs running on a grassy field during daylight hours. The dog on the left appears to be predominantly light-colored with darker markings, possibly a hound breed such as a Beagle or Foxhound, characterized by its short coat and distinctive coloration—white, brown, and black. This dog is in mid-stride, appearing playful and energetic.

The second dog, positioned slightly further back and to the right, has a similar color pattern—a mix of white, black, and brown, which is typical for breeds like Foxhounds or Beagles. However, it also seems to have a more distinctively tricolor coat (white, black, and brown/black patches). This dog is walking calmly, heading away from the viewer.

The setting includes a grass-covered field bordered by what looks like a wooden fence line and some trees, indicating this could be a park or backyard area. Sunlight filters through tree branches, casting distinct shadows of the dogs onto the ground.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of brown and white in the dog category. 
 description: The dog in the picture is a Basset Hound, characterized by its long, floppy ears, short muzzle, and droopy eyes—a trait often associated with the breed's gentle and calm demeanor. Its coat is predominantly a rich brown on the head, ears, and part of its body, contrasting beautifully with creamy or white fur covering much of its chest and legs. The dog appears attentive and poised, possibly listening to something off-camera. It's adorned with a black collar that has a distinctive, star-shaped tag hanging from it, which could indicate it's a pet with some personality! The lush greenery and potted plants in the background add a vibrant, naturalistic touch to the scene, creating a serene and picturesque environment for our canine companion.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of brown-fur in the dog category. 
 description: The animal in the picture appears to be a dhole (Canis dingo), also known as the dhole or dhole dog. It has distinct reddish-brown fur with a lighter underbelly and legs, which is characteristic of this species. The dhole's coat is short and smooth, and it has a slender build compared to other canines. Its ears are large and pointed, alerting us to its keen senses. The background suggests a forested area, typical of where these animals roam freely.

If you're identifying animals, the reddish-brown coloration and the size and shape of the body and head are key features that help differentiate between a fox and a dhole. Foxes tend to have more reddish-orange coats but often with a more fox-like face and tail.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of pointed-ears in the dog category. 
 description: The animal in the picture appears to be a dhole (also known as the dingo or wild dog), identifiable by its slender build and pointed ears, which are characteristic features of this species. The dhole's coat is reddish-brown with a lighter underbelly, and it has a bushy tail that tapers to a point—a trait shared with foxes but more pronounced here. Its ears are large, erect, and rounded at the tips, which helps amplify hearing—an important adaptation for a predator. The surrounding environment, with grass, trees, and scattered pine cones, suggests a woodland habitat typical of where these animals roam.

If you're identifying wildlife, it's crucial to ensure accuracy. The animal depicted resembles a dhole, also known scientifically as Canis dingo, which is native to South and Southeast Asia. However, distinguishing between closely related species like wolves, foxes, and dogs can sometimes be challenging without expert knowledge or additional context clues such as size, body proportions, or geographic location.

 description: The animal in the picture appears to be a dhole (also known as the dingo or wild dog), characterized by its reddish-brown fur, a long tail, and pointed ears. Its coat is thick and reddish-orange with lighter underparts, and it has a bushy tail that is darker at the tip. The setting seems to be a forested or wooded area with grass and some trees, suggesting a natural habitat for such a species.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of white_fur in the dog category. 
 description: The dog in the picture is a Sealyham Terrier, characterized by its distinctive white fur with a black and tan face marking. The coat appears fluffy and well-groomed, covering most of its body evenly. Its fur looks thick and soft, typical of breeds that have been historically bred for their working abilities rather than as show dogs, which can sometimes influence grooming styles.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of short_legs in the dog category. 
 description: The dog in the picture appears to be a Sealyham Terrier, which is characterized by its distinctive short stature and wiry, dense coat. The coat is predominantly white with some darker markings on the head, particularly around the eyes and ears. The dog has a compact, sturdy build typical of the breed, with a level topline and a tail that is docked, ending in a tuft of hair. The background suggests a grassy outdoor setting, providing a nice contrast to the dog's fluffy, white fur.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of black_mask in the dog category. 
 description: The dog in the picture appears to be a Sealyham Terrier, which is characterized by its distinctive black mask covering the forehead and ears, with a white or cream-colored body. The coat is short and wiry, and it has a slightly rough, textured look. The dog's fur around the face is longer and softer-looking, framing a face that looks somewhat surprised or curious. The background suggests a grassy outdoor setting, providing a nice contrast to the dog's bright, fluffy coat.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of large pointed ears in the dog category. 
 description: The animal in the picture is not a dog but rather a wild dog, specifically an African painted dog (also known as the painted wolf or wild dog). Its visual attributes include:

1. **Coloration and Markings**: The animal has a distinctive coat with a mix of black, white, and tan fur, which is typical for African painted dogs. The pattern is unique to each individual.

2. **Ears**: It has upright, rounded ears that are characteristic of the species, often appearing more "dog-like" than those of wolves.

3. **Size and Build**: While it may share some physical traits with domestic dogs, its body structure and proportions resemble that of a medium-sized wild canine, such as a wolf or a jackal.

4. **Setting**: The background suggests a naturalistic habitat, possibly a zoo or wildlife reserve, characterized by dry soil, sparse vegetation, and a tree trunk partially visible in the background.

These features collectively indicate this is likely an African painted dog, a wild canid species native to Africa.

 description: The dog in the picture appears to be a Bloodhound, identifiable by its droopy ears and muscular build. Its fur is predominantly light brown or tan, with darker shading on the muzzle, eyebrows, and ears. The dog's coat looks well-groomed, and it has a distinctive, thick, and floppy outer layer of fur typical of breeds like the Bloodhound. The dog is wearing a red collar adorned with a silver buckle and charm, which adds a pop of color against its fur. The setting seems to be outdoors, possibly in a park or urban area, as indicated by the pavement, railing, and background elements such as trash bags and buildings.

 description: The dog in the picture appears to be a Bloodhound, identifiable by its droopy ears and muscular build. The floppy ears suggest it's a mature adult, as puppies typically have tighter, more upright ears. The floppy ears also indicate that this is likely a male dog, as intact males (neutered) often carry floppy ears, which contrasts with bitches who tend to have perked-up ears after estrus. The floppy ears complement the dog's calm demeanor and the urban, somewhat chilly backdrop.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of black_fur in the dog category. 
 description: The image shows a close-up of a large, fluffy, black dog with curly fur. The dog's fur is predominantly thick and appears to be quite long and unkempt, covering its face and body densely. Its eyes are partially obscured by the fur, giving it a somewhat grumpy or confused look. The dog has a broad, flat nose that is dark grayish-black, contrasting sharply with the lighter, sandy-colored pavement on which it stands. A pink tongue is slightly protruding from the dog's mouth, adding a playful touch to the expression. The background includes part of a concrete surface, some scattered debris, and what seems to be a hose lying nearby, suggesting this photo might have been taken outdoors, possibly in a backyard or driveway area.

 description: The dog in the picture has predominantly black fur with some white markings on its chest and muzzle. Its face is expressive, with dark, soulful eyes and a slightly open mouth showing a pink tongue. The fur appears thick and somewhat unkempt, giving it a charming, shaggy look. A small, triangular, light-colored tag is visible hanging from around its neck. The background includes a window with sheer curtains, allowing sunlight to illuminate the scene, and part of a patterned yellow cushion can be seen behind the dog.

 description: The dog in the picture has predominantly black fur with some white markings on its underside and legs. The fur appears fluffy and somewhat unkempt, giving it a charming, scruffy look. There is a small, triangular-shaped tag attached to its collar, which seems to be metallic or reflective. The background includes a window with sheer curtains, allowing sunlight to filter through, creating a bright and airy atmosphere indoors.

 description: The dog in the picture has dark fur with lighter shades around its muzzle and chest. It appears to be a small, shaggy breed with a somewhat grumpy or curious facial expression. The dog's eyes are a striking blue-gray color, and it is looking attentively towards something outside the frame, possibly out of curiosity or interest. The lighting suggests that there is sunlight coming through the window, creating a bright and warm atmosphere indoors.

summarize_attributes: the dog in the picture is a sealyham terrier, characterized by its long, silky, and slightly wavy white fur with some light brown markings on the paws and muzzle. it has a compact, sturdy build with a level topline, and the hair is longer and more abundant around the body, giving it a distinctive, elegant look. the ears are long and hang down gracefully, and the tail is docked, which is common for show dogs. the grooming style emphasizes the breed's unique features, including the beard, eyebrows, and the slightly arched back.
