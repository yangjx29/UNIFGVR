Otherwise, there might be something wrong with your environment. Did you have `libjpeg` or `libpng` installed before building `torchvision` from source?
  warn(
Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.

The image processor of type `Qwen2VLImageProcessor` is now loaded as a fast processor by default, even if the model checkpoint was saved with a slow processor. This is a breaking change and may produce slightly different outputs. To continue using the slow processor, instantiate this class with `use_fast=False`. Note that this behavior will be extended to all models in a future release.
`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of white fur in the dog category. 
 description: The image shows two Boston Terriers with distinct patches of white and black fur. Here's a description of their visual attributes:

1. **Coloration**: The dogs have a predominantly black coat with distinct patches of white fur on their faces, chests, and paws.
2. **Ears**: Both dogs have upright ears that stand alert.
3. **Muzzle and Snout**: They both have a white muzzle and a white stripe extending from the center of their forehead down to their noses.
4. **Body Markings**: The white fur is concentrated primarily on their chests, bellies, and paws, while the rest of their bodies has a darker, possibly black or brown, coat.
5. **Posture and Expression**: The dogs appear attentive and alert, with their heads slightly tilted upward as if they're listening to something or observing their surroundings.

This type of coloration is characteristic of certain breeds, such as the Boston Terrier, which typically have a combination of white and another color (often black). The white markings can vary in size and shape but often follow symmetrical patterns across the body. In this case, the white fur is prominent on their faces, chests, and paws, contrasting sharply with their darker coats.

 description: The image shows a dog with floppy ears, which is characteristic of certain breeds such as the Basset Hound. Floppy ears are a distinct feature that can be visually identified by their soft, loose, and hanging-down appearance. In this particular image, the dog's ears are floppy,垂下，松软且挂在脸上。这种耳朵形状通常与以下特征相关：

1. **Soft Texture**: Floppy ears often appear to have a softer, more pliable texture compared to upright or pointed ears.
2. **Loose Skin**: The skin around floppy ears tends to be looser and more relaxed, allowing the ears to droop freely without much tension.
3. **Shape and Size**: Floppy ears typically have a rounded, triangular shape that extends downward from the head. They can vary in size depending on the breed but generally appear larger and more prominent than upright ears.
4. **Color and Markings**: Floppy ears may have the same color as the rest of the dog's coat or may display different colors or patterns. For example, in the image provided, the dog has brown and white fur with floppy, brown ears.

Floppy ears are not only a physical attribute but also a breed-specific trait that can influence the dog's overall appearance and

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of thin straight legs in the dog category. 
 description: The image shows two dogs sitting on a carpeted floor indoors. The dog on the left has light brown fur and is sitting with its front legs extended forward, displaying what appear to be relatively straight and thin legs. The dog on the right has white and brown fur and is standing with its front legs slightly bent, but they also seem to have a straight and thin appearance. Both dogs exhibit lean builds, which contributes to the perception of their legs as being thin and straight. However, it's important to note that the term "thin" can sometimes imply a lack of muscle mass or fat, which isn't always desirable for health reasons. In this context, the dogs' legs look proportionate and fit within typical canine anatomy.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of pointy ears in the dog category. 
 description: The image you've provided shows a small dog with fluffy, light-colored fur and a distinct facial structure that includes a short muzzle and expressive eyes. The dog's ears are not clearly visible as they appear to be folded or relaxed rather than standing upright. However, based on the context of your question, if we consider typical breeds known for having pointy ears, such as Pekingese or Shih Tzu, here are some general visual attributes:

1. **Ears**: Typically, dogs with pointy ears have upright, triangular-shaped ears that stand out prominently from their head.
2. **Fur Texture and Color**: The fur can vary widely depending on the breed but often appears silky, smooth, or slightly wavy.
3. **Facial Features**: Dogs with prominent ears may also display other characteristic features like a small, expressive face, a compact body, and a friendly or alert demeanor.

In this specific image, the dog does not have upright, pointy ears. Instead, its ears seem to be floppy and relaxed, which is more characteristic of breeds like Pekingese or Shih Tzu, who typically do not have sharply pointed ears. If you're looking for a dog with pointy ears, you might want to look at breeds such as the

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of wide flat tail in the dog category. 
 description: The image you've provided shows a dog lying on grass with its tongue out. The dog appears to be a German Shepherd, characterized by its distinctive black and tan coat, erect ears, and a broad head. The dog's tail is not prominently visible in this image, but based on typical breed characteristics, it would likely have a tail that is short, thick, and curves upward at the end, rather than being wide or flat.

If we consider the question about a "wide flat tail" in the context of dogs, it seems there might be some confusion since the German Shepherd in the image has a tail that is relatively short and thick, but not particularly wide or flat. German Shepherds typically have a tail that is thick at the base, tapers slightly toward the tip, and curls upward, which is quite different from a wide, flat tail. 

In summary, the dog in the image does not appear to have a wide, flat tail.

The fur texture looks dense and slightly rough, rather than soft and smooth. The dog's ears are floppy and covered by the same thick fur as the rest of its body. The overall appearance suggests a medium to coarse coat, which is typical for breeds like the Schnauzer, rather than a soft and smooth skin texture. If the question refers to a specific type of dog with "soft smooth skin," it might be misleading because this particular dog has a more rugged and textured coat. However, if we consider the general characteristics of dogs with soft and smooth coats, they typically have fur that feels silky to the touch, lacks noticeable bumps or ridges, and may have a lustrous or glossy sheen. This particular dog does not exhibit those traits.

 description: The image you've provided does not depict a dog with brown fur. Instead, it shows a wild dog (likely an African wild dog) standing on a dirt and grassy area. The dog has a coat that is primarily black and tan with white markings, but there isn't any brown fur visible in this image. If you're asking about the visual attributes of brown fur in dogs, typically, brown fur can appear in various shades ranging from light beige to deep mahogany. It's often seen in breeds like the Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, and Beagle. However, the dog in the image appears to be a wild animal, possibly an African wild dog, which doesn't belong to the domesticated dog breed category.

 description: The image you've provided does not depict a dog with predominantly black fur. Instead, it shows a wild dog (likely an African wild dog) with a coat that includes black, brown, and white markings. The dog's fur is primarily composed of these colors, with no visible areas of pure black fur.

If you're asking about the visual attributes of black fur in dogs, typically:

- **Color:** Pure or near-black fur can appear as a solid, deep, dark shade.
- **Texture:** The fur may have a smooth, sleek appearance, though some breeds might have slightly rougher textures due to their coat type.
- **Markings/Patterns:** In dogs, black fur can sometimes be accompanied by other colors like white, brown, or tan, creating patterns such as patches, spots, or stripes.
- **Lighting Effects:** Depending on the lighting, the black fur might reflect light differently, appearing glossy or dull.

In this specific image, the dog has a mix of black, brown, and white fur, which is not typical for a dog with predominantly black fur. If you're referring to a dog breed with predominantly black fur, examples would include breeds like the Labrador Retriever, German Shepherd, or Rottweiler, where the black

Instead, it shows a wild dog (likely an African wild dog) with a coat that is primarily black and tan with some white markings. The white markings on this particular animal appear as small spots or patches scattered across its body, rather than covering a significant portion of its fur. If you're asking about dogs with predominantly white fur, those would typically have coats that are mostly white, with perhaps some faint or subtle coloration like light brown, gray, or even a hint of black. In this case, the dog's fur is predominantly black and tan with some white markings, but there is no significant amount of white fur to describe as "predominantly" in the context of a dog's coat.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of short stubby legs in the dog category. 
 description: The image shows a dog with short and stubby-looking legs, which is characteristic of certain breeds. Here's a description based on the visual attributes:

- The dog has a medium to large-sized body.
- Its legs appear short and sturdy, giving it a compact and solid look.
- The fur on its legs is relatively thick and may be slightly darker than the rest of its coat.
- The overall posture suggests that the dog is in motion, possibly running or jumping, as its front legs are bent and its back legs are extended.

This breed appears to have a thick, shaggy coat, which could be indicative of a specific breed known for such characteristics. However, without additional context or information about the breed, it's challenging to definitively identify the dog based solely on these visual attributes.

 description: The image shows two dogs running on a grassy field. The dog on the left has predominantly light brown fur with some white markings on its chest and legs. The dog on the right also has light brown fur but is marked with distinct black and white patches, including a white stripe down its back and face. Both dogs appear to be of similar breeds, possibly basenjis or a similar short-haired breed, characterized by their lean build, smooth coat, and distinctive facial features such as large, expressive eyes and perked-up ears. The setting appears to be an open grassy area, likely a park or a field, providing ample space for the dogs to run freely.

 description: The image shows two dogs with brown fur lying on a rocky surface. Here are some visual attributes of their brown fur:

1. **Color and Tone**: The fur appears to be a rich, warm brown with subtle variations in shade. Some areas may have slightly lighter or darker tones.
2. **Texture**: The fur looks thick and well-groomed, suggesting a healthy coat. It has a medium length, neither too short nor too long, which is typical for many dog breeds.
3. **Coat Type**: The fur seems to be dense and possibly wavy or slightly curly, as it drapes smoothly over the dogs' bodies.
4. **Ears and Face**: The ears and face area show a darker brown hue compared to the rest of the body, creating a contrast that highlights the facial features.
5. **Body Coverage**: The brown fur covers most of the visible parts of the dogs' bodies, including their heads, necks, and chests.

These attributes contribute to the overall appearance of the dogs, making them look healthy and well-maintained.

 description: The image shows two dogs lying on a rock with a forested background. The dog on the left has a coat that is predominantly light brown with some darker shades, while the dog on the right has a coat that is predominantly dark brown with some lighter shades.

If we were to focus specifically on the dog on the right, which has a coat that includes black fur, we would note that the black fur appears as patches or streaks within the overall dark brown coloration of its coat. The black fur is not prominent and does not cover the entire body; rather, it is part of a mixed coat pattern. The dog's fur texture looks thick and well-groomed, and the black fur is distributed across the back and possibly the head, though this is not clearly visible due to the angle and lighting. The dog's ears appear to be dark, blending into the black fur, and the tail is also dark, matching the black fur on the back. The overall impression is that the dog has a rich, dark coat with some lighter shades, but there is no black fur that stands out prominently in the image.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of black fur in the dog category. 
 description: The image shows a dog with thick, curly black fur that appears to be well-groomed and shiny. The fur is dense, giving the dog a robust and sturdy appearance. The coat looks slightly wavy or curly, which adds texture and depth to the overall look. The dog's ears are floppy, and its face has distinct facial hair, including a beard-like growth around the muzzle. The dog also has a collar, suggesting it might be a pet. The fur's color is a deep, rich black, which contrasts nicely against the lighter background of the ground and the sky. The dog's posture is alert, with one paw slightly raised, and its mouth is open, showing a relaxed expression.

 description: The image shows a dog with thick, curly black fur that appears to be well-groomed and voluminous. The fur is dense and wavy, giving the dog a distinctive and somewhat shaggy appearance. The texture of the fur looks soft and fluffy, contributing to the overall impression of thickness. The dog's coat is predominantly dark, possibly black or a deep brown, and the curls are tightly packed, creating a lush and full look. The dog's ears are floppy and blend seamlessly into the body's fur, enhancing the perception of thickness. The fur around the neck and chest is particularly thick, adding to the dog's robust and sturdy appearance. The dog also has a collar, which is visible and contrasts with the dark fur. The background is a simple outdoor setting, likely a paved area, which helps to emphasize the dog's thick, curly coat.

 description: The image shows a dog with floppy ears, which is characteristic of certain breeds such as the Basset Hound. Floppy ears are a distinct feature that can be visually identified by their soft, loose, and hanging-down appearance. In this particular image, the dog's ears are floppy,垂下，松软且挂在脸上。这种耳朵形状通常与以下特征相关：

1. **Soft Texture**: Floppy ears often appear to have a softer, more pliable texture compared to upright or pointed ears.
2. **Loose Skin**: The skin around floppy ears tends to be looser and more relaxed, allowing the ears to droop freely without much tension.
3. **Shape and Size**: Floppy ears typically have a rounded, triangular shape that extends downward from the head. They can vary in size depending on the breed but generally appear larger and more prominent than upright ears.
4. **Color and Markings**: Floppy ears may have the same color as the rest of the dog's coat or may display different colors or patterns. For example, in the image provided, the dog has brown and white fur with floppy, brown ears.

Floppy ears are not only a physical attribute but also a breed-specific trait that can influence the dog's overall appearance and

 description: The image you've provided shows a dog standing on snow-covered ground with trees and a body of water in the background. The dog appears to be a large breed with a thick, straight coat that is predominantly brown in color. Its face has distinct features such as floppy ears, expressive eyes, and a sturdy muzzle. The dog's body posture suggests it is standing calmly, and its thick fur likely extends down to cover its legs, though the exact thickness or straightness of the legs isn't clearly visible due to the angle and the dog's positioning.

If you're asking about the visual attributes of thick, straight legs in this dog, based on the image:

- **Coat Texture:** The dog's fur looks thick and dense, which could contribute to the perception of thick legs.
- **Leg Appearance:** While the dog's legs aren't fully visible in this image, they seem proportionate to the rest of the body, suggesting neither excessively long nor short proportions.
- **Posture:** The dog stands squarely, and the stance gives the impression of sturdy, well-built legs.
- **Coloration:** The fur is a rich, warm brown, which contrasts nicely against the white snow, highlighting the dog's form.

However, the image doesn't provide a clear view of

 description: The image you've provided shows a small dog with fluffy, light-colored fur and a distinct facial structure that includes a short muzzle and expressive eyes. The dog's ears are not clearly visible as they appear to be folded or relaxed rather than standing upright. However, based on the context of your question, if we consider typical breeds known for having pointy ears, such as Pekingese or Shih Tzu, here are some general visual attributes:

1. **Ears**: Typically, dogs with pointy ears have upright, triangular-shaped ears that stand out prominently from their head.
2. **Fur Texture and Color**: The fur can vary widely depending on the breed but often appears silky, smooth, or slightly wavy.
3. **Facial Features**: Dogs with prominent ears may also display other characteristic features like a small, expressive face, a compact body, and a friendly or alert demeanor.

In this specific image, the dog does not have upright, pointy ears. Instead, its ears seem to be floppy and relaxed, which is more characteristic of breeds like Pekingese or Shih Tzu, who typically do not have sharply pointed ears.

 description: The image you've provided shows a dog lying on grass with its tongue out. The dog appears to be a German Shepherd, identifiable by its distinctive features such as a broad head, erect ears, and a short, smooth coat that is predominantly black with tan markings. The dog's tail is not clearly visible in this image, so it cannot be determined if the dog has a wide flat tail or a different type of tail based solely on this image. However, typically, a German Shepherd does not have a wide, flat tail; rather, they tend to have a tail that is more rounded at the base and tapers towards the tip. If the tail were visible, it would likely appear narrow and tapering, not wide and flat.

 description: The image you've provided does not depict a dog with predominantly black fur. Instead, it shows a wild dog (likely an African wild dog) with a coat that includes black, brown, and white markings. The dog's fur is primarily composed of these colors, with no visible areas of pure black fur.

If you're asking about the visual attributes of black fur in dogs, typically:

- **Color:** Pure or near-black fur can appear as a solid, deep, dark shade.
- **Texture:** The fur may have a smooth, sleek texture, especially if it's well-groomed.
- **Distribution:** In dogs, this coloration might be present on the head, ears, back, or tail, depending on the breed and individual dog.
- **Markings:** Some breeds or individuals may have additional colors mixed into the black fur, such as white, tan, or brown spots or patches.

In the image you've shared, the dog has a mix of black, brown, and white fur, but there isn't a prominent area of pure, solid black fur. If you're referring to a dog with predominantly black fur, it would typically show a uniform, deep, dark shade without any contrasting colors.

   - The chest also displays some white fur with a small patch of light brown near the neck.

3. **Other Features**:
   - The dog has a white stripe down the center of its face from the forehead to the muzzle.
   - The muzzle itself is primarily white with a small patch of light brown near the nose.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of pointy ears in the dog category. 
 description: The image you've provided does not depict a dog with pointy ears. Instead, it shows a dog that appears to be a Chow Chow breed, characterized by its thick, fluffy fur and a distinctive facial structure. The Chow Chow typically has a broad head, a short muzzle, and a beard-like growth of fur around the mouth. Its ears are usually small, rounded, and set high on the head, often giving them a folded or semi-folded appearance rather than being upright or pointed.

If you're looking for a dog with pointy ears, you might consider breeds like the Boston Terrier, the Beagle, or the Dachshund. These breeds generally have ears that stand up straight from the head, often appearing triangular or V-shaped when viewed from above. The Boston Terrier, for example, has small, triangular, upright ears, while the Beagle's ears are long, floppy, and hang down close to the cheeks. The Dachshund, although not typically described as having "pointy ears," can have ears that are more upright compared to other dachshund breeds, but they are generally not as sharply pointed as those found in some other breeds.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of brown fur in the dog category. 
 description: The image shows two dogs with brown fur lying on a rocky surface. Here are some visual attributes of their brown fur:

1. **Color and Tone**: The fur appears to be a rich, warm brown with subtle variations in shade. Some areas may have slightly lighter or darker tones.
2. **Texture**: The fur looks thick and well-groomed, giving the impression of a healthy coat. The texture seems smooth and possibly slightly wavy or curly in places.
3. **Length**: The fur length varies slightly between the two dogs. One has longer fur that drapes over its body, while the other has shorter fur that is more closely cropped.
4. **Markings**: There are distinct markings on the dogs' faces, necks, and bodies. These include darker shades around the eyes, ears, and muzzle, which contrast with the lighter brown fur on the rest of their bodies.
5. **Condition**: The fur looks clean and well-maintained, suggesting good grooming and care.

These attributes contribute to the overall appearance of the dogs as healthy and well-cared-for animals.

 description: The image shows two dogs lying on a rock with a forested background. The dog on the left has a coat that is predominantly light brown with some darker shades, while the dog on the right has a coat that is predominantly dark brown with some lighter shades.

If we were to focus specifically on the dog on the right, which has a coat that includes black fur, we would note that the black fur appears as patches or streaks within the overall dark brown coloration of its coat. The black fur is not prominent and does not cover the entire body; rather, it is part of a mixed coat pattern. The dog's fur texture looks thick and well-groomed, and the black fur is distributed across the back and possibly the head, though this is not clearly visible due to the angle and lighting. The dog's ears appear to be dark, blending into the black fur, and the tail is also dark, matching the black fur on the back. The overall impression is that the dog has a rich, dark coat with some lighter shades, but there is no black fur that stands out prominently in the image.
