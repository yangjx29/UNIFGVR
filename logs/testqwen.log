output_text: ["The image shows a small dog, likely a Chihuahua, peeking out from inside a purple bag. The dog has a black and white coat with a distinctive pattern on its face, including a white stripe down the middle of its forehead and a white patch around its mouth. The dog's ears are perked up, and it appears to be looking directly at the camera with an alert expression. The bag is made of a soft material and has a zipper closure. The background includes a wall and part of what looks like a reflective surface, possibly a mirror or a metallic object, which is partially visible in the bottom right corner of the image. The lighting suggests that the photo was taken outdoors during the daytime."]
