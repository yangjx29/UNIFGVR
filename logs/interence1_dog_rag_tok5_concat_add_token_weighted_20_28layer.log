Otherwise, there might be something wrong with your environment. Did you have `libjpeg` or `libpng` installed before building `torchvision` from source?
  warn(
Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.

The image processor of type `Qwen2VLImageProcessor` is now loaded as a fast processor by default, even if the model checkpoint was saved with a slow processor. This is a breaking change and may produce slightly different outputs. To continue using the slow processor, instantiate this class with `use_fast=False`. Note that this behavior will be extended to all models in a future release.
`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of small size in the dog category. 
 description: The dog in the picture appears to be small in size, which is characteristic of certain breeds known for their petite stature. Here are some visual attributes that contribute to this perception:

1. **Proportionate Size**: The dog's body is relatively short and compact, with no exaggerated proportions that would suggest it belongs to a larger breed.
2. **Head and Face**: The head is small in proportion to its body, with a short muzzle and expressive, large eyes that give it an endearing look.
3. **Legs and Body Frame**: The legs appear short, and the overall body frame is slim and not bulky, further emphasizing the small stature.
4. **Coat Texture and Length**: The fur looks fluffy but not overly long or heavy, which can sometimes make dogs of smaller breeds appear lighter and more delicate.

These attributes collectively contribute to the impression that the dog is indeed a small-sized breed.
