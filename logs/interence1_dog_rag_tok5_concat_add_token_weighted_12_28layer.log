Otherwise, there might be something wrong with your environment. Did you have `libjpeg` or `libpng` installed before building `torchvision` from source?
  warn(
Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.

The image processor of type `Qwen2VLImageProcessor` is now loaded as a fast processor by default, even if the model checkpoint was saved with a slow processor. This is a breaking change and may produce slightly different outputs. To continue using the slow processor, instantiate this class with `use_fast=False`. Note that this behavior will be extended to all models in a future release.
`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!

   - A black mask-like area covering around their eyes, ears, and snout.
   - A white blaze or stripe that runs down the center of their forehead and nose.
   - White fur around their muzzle, cheeks, and chest, contrasting sharply with the darker fur on their bodies.

3. **Body Shape**: They appear to be compact and muscular, typical of the Boston Terrier breed, with short, sturdy legs and a broad head.

4. **Posture and Expression**: The dogs are sitting upright, alert, and looking attentively towards something off-camera, showcasing their attentive and curious demeanor.

5. **Setting**: The environment suggests a home setting, with wooden flooring, furniture, and household items visible

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of muddy coat in the dog category. 
 description: The dog in the picture has a fluffy, light-colored coat that is visibly covered with mud and dirt. The fur appears to be wet, likely from being in water or through play in a muddy environment.

In this case, the dog seems to have a compact build with fur covering most of its legs, making them not very visible from this angle. The dog also has a playful demeanor, indicated by its open mouth and tongue out, suggesting it might be enjoying itself outdoors.

 description: The image shows a French Bulldog with distinct physical and behavioral traits:

1. **Physical Appearance**:
   - **Size and Build**: The dog is small to medium-sized, with a sturdy, compact body typical of the breed.
   - **Head Shape**: It has a broad, flat skull, a short muzzle, and a pushed-in nose, which are characteristic features of French Bulldogs.
   - **Ears**: The ears are small, triangular, and often cropped or left uncropped, as seen here where they stand upright but slightly folded at the tips.
   - **Tail**: The tail is typically short and carried curled over the back, though this can vary among individuals.
   - **Coat Texture and Color**: The coat appears smooth and short-haired, with a mix of white and brown patches. Some areas may show slight discoloration or fading.

2. **Behavioral Traits (Inferred from Behavior in Image)**:
   - The dog seems relaxed and calm, sitting patiently on a surface, suggesting it might be comfortable in its environment.
   - Its posture indicates attentiveness or mild curiosity, as it looks off to one side rather than directly facing the camera.

 description: The image you've provided does not depict a Labrador Retriever. Instead, it shows a French Bulldog, which is a breed known for its distinctive features:

1. **Size and Build**: French Bulldogs typically have a compact, muscular build with a sturdy frame.
2. **Head and Face**: They have a broad, square-shaped head with a short muzzle, large bat-like ears that often hang down to the sides, and a strong, slightly undershot jawline (where the lower jaw extends beyond the upper jaw).
3. **Coat and Fur**: Their coat tends to be smooth and short-haired, though some may have a slightly rough texture. The fur can vary in color, including brindle, fawn, white, or combinations thereof.
4. **Color Variations**: French Bulldogs commonly come in a variety of colors, such as fawn, brindle, pied (white with patches of another color), and sometimes with white markings.

The dog in the image appears to be a French Bulldog rather than a Labrador Retriever based on these characteristics. Labradors generally have a longer, more streamlined body, a broader head, and a different facial structure with a more pronounced stop (the point where the forehead meets the nose).

 description: The image you've provided shows a dog with long, flowing fur that appears to be a breed resembling the Afghan Hound. Afghan Hounds typically have a slender build and long, silky hair covering their body. The dog in the image has a sleek, dark coat with a glossy sheen, and its ears are long and drooping, which is characteristic of this breed. The face is elongated, with a narrow muzzle and a calm, elegant expression. The background suggests an outdoor setting with greenery and flowers, adding to the serene and graceful appearance of the dog.

If you're referring to "thin straight legs," it's important to note that the Afghan Hound, as depicted in the image, does not have visible "thin straight legs" due to the angle and framing of the photo. Afghan Hounds generally have a lean, athletic build with long, slender legs that are not prominently displayed in this particular image. Their legs tend to be proportionate to their body size and are often seen as part of their overall elegant and streamlined form.

1. **Ears**: The ears are long and drooping, not pointy.
2. **Fur Texture**: The fur is predominantly black with some lighter, possibly grayish or white, streaks near the base of the ears and on the chest.
3. **Coloration**: The dog has a predominantly dark coat, which is consistent with the coloration often seen in Afghan Hounds, though this particular individual may have a slightly different shade compared to traditional Afghan Hounds which typically have a fawn or brindle pattern with black points.
4. **Background**: The background includes greenery and what seems to be light purple flowers, suggesting an outdoor setting.

If you're referring to a specific breed description, it might be helpful to note that the dog in the picture resembles characteristics of an Afghan Hound, such as its long, silky coat and the general body structure. However, the ears being described as "pointy" do not align with the typical appearance of an Afghan Hound, which generally has long, drooping ears rather than pointy ones.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of brown fur in the dog category. 
 description: The image you've provided does not depict a dog but rather what appears to be a dhole (also known as the Asiatic wild dog), which is not a typical "dog" but a type of canid native to South and Southeast Asia. Here's a description of its visual attributes:

1. **Coloration**: The animal has predominantly reddish-brown or golden fur covering most of its body.
2. **Fur Texture**: The fur looks thick and somewhat coarse, with a slightly shaggy appearance on the neck and chest area.
3. **Facial Features**: It has a slender muzzle, pointed ears, and a short tail that is darker at the tip.
4. **Body Shape**: The body is lean and muscular, with a compact frame and relatively long legs.
5. **Environment**: The setting seems to be a natural habitat with grassy terrain, suggesting it might be in a forested or open woodland area.

If you're referring to a dog, the brown fur would typically appear in shades ranging from light tan to deep auburn, often with a mix of lighter and darker tones across the body. The texture could vary from smooth to slightly wavy, depending on the breed. However, the animal in the image more closely resembles

 description: The image you've provided does not depict a dog but rather what appears to be a dhole (Cuon alpinus), also known as the Asiatic wild dog or the "Indian wild dog." However, if we consider the pointed ears as a characteristic feature and compare it with dogs, here's how they might appear:

1. **Ears Shape**: The pointed ears on this animal are tall and stand upright, which is a common trait among many dog breeds. They are typically triangular in shape, pointing sharply upwards from the head.

2. **Positioning**: The ears are positioned at the top of the head, slightly forward-facing, which allows for acute hearing and alertness.

3. **Texture and Color**: The fur covering the ears can vary widely depending on the breed. In this case, the pointed ears have a reddish-brown hue that matches the rest of the animal's coat.

4. **Size and Proportionality**: The ears are proportionate to the size of the head and body, neither too large nor too small, maintaining balance with the overall appearance of the animal.

In the context of the image, the pointed ears are indeed a key feature, contributing significantly to the animal's attentive and alert demeanor.

This mane helps protect the neck from bites during fights and provides insulation. The dhole in the image has reddish-brown fur, a slender build, and pointed ears, all typical features of this species.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of floppy ears in the dog category. 
 description: The dog in the picture has floppy ears that are characteristic of certain breeds, such as the English Springer Spaniel. Here are some visual attributes of floppy ears:

1. **Shape and Texture**: Floppy ears typically have a soft, rounded shape with a slight curve at the tips. They often have a silky or wavy texture, as seen here where the hair is long and slightly curled.

2. **Positioning on Head**: Floppy ears hang loosely from the sides of the head, often draping down to rest near the shoulders.

3. **Color and Markings**: The color of the fur on the ears can vary depending on the breed and individual dog. In this case, the dog's ears appear dark brown with a lighter, curly texture.

4. **Attachment to Head**: Floppy ears are attached to the head by a thin fold of skin, which allows them to droop freely without standing upright.

5. **Functionality**: Floppy ears help protect the dog’s face from wind, dust, and debris, as well as provide insulation against cold weather.

In the image, the dog's ears are prominently displayed, showcasing their soft, rounded, and slightly curled appearance, which aligns with the typical floppy ear characteristics.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of large paws in the dog category. 
 description: The dog in the picture appears to be a Newfoundland breed, which is known for its large, sturdy paws. Here are some visual attributes that might indicate "large paws" in this context:

1. **Size and Shape**: The paws of Newfoundlands tend to be quite large compared to their body size. They are broad and flat, which helps them distribute weight evenly on uneven or rocky terrains.

2. **Fur Texture and Coverage**: The fur around the paws can sometimes appear slightly longer and fluffier than on other parts of the body, giving the appearance of being "fluffy."

3. **Proportion to Body Size**: In comparison to the rest of the dog's body, the paws seem proportionally large. This is typical for breeds like the Newfoundland, which have been selectively bred for strength and endurance, often working in environments where they need to navigate rough or uneven ground.

4. **Color and Texture**: The fur covering the paws may be thick and dense, similar to the rest of the dog’s coat, but it tends to be shorter and less fluffy specifically around the paw pads, which are typically darker in color.

In the provided image, the dog's paws do indeed appear substantial in size, consistent with

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of brown fur in the dog category. 
 description: The image you've provided does not depict a dog but rather what appears to be a dhole (also known as the Asiatic wild dog), which is not a typical "dog" but a type of canid native to South and Southeast Asia. Here's a description of its visual attributes:

1. **Coloration**: The animal has predominantly reddish-brown or golden fur covering most of its body.
2. **Fur Texture**: The fur looks thick and somewhat coarse, with a slightly shaggy appearance on the neck and chest area.
3. **Facial Features**: It has a slender muzzle, pointed ears, and a short tail that is darker at the tip.
4. **Body Shape**: The body is lean and muscular, with a compact frame and relatively long legs.
5. **Environment**: The setting seems to be a natural habitat with grassy terrain, suggesting it could be in a forested or open woodland area.

If you're referring to a dog, the brown fur would typically appear in shades ranging from light tan to deep auburn, often with a mix of lighter and darker tones across the body. The texture might vary from smooth to slightly wavy, depending on the breed. However, the animal in the image more closely resembles

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of pointed ears in the dog category. 
 description: The image you've provided does not depict a dog but rather what appears to be a dhole (Cuon alpinus), also known as the Asiatic wild dog or the "Indian wild dog." However, if we consider the pointed ears as a characteristic feature and compare it with dogs, here's how they might appear:

1. **Ears Shape**: The pointed ears on this animal are tall and stand upright, which is a common trait among many dog breeds. They are typically triangular in shape, pointing sharply upwards from the head.

2. **Positioning**: The ears are positioned at the top of the head, slightly forward-facing, which allows for acute hearing and alertness.

3. **Texture and Color**: The fur covering the ears can vary widely depending on the breed. In this case, the pointed ears have a reddish-brown hue that matches the rest of the animal's coat.

4. **Size and Proportionality**: The ears are proportionate to the size of the head and body, neither too large nor too small, maintaining balance with the overall appearance of the animal.

In the context of the image, the pointed ears are indeed a key feature, contributing significantly to the animal's attentive and alert demeanor.

 description: The image you've provided does not depict a dog but rather what appears to be a dhole (Cuon alpinus), also known as the Asiatic wild dog or the "black-backed jackal." The thick fur around its neck is characteristic of this species and is often referred to as a "mane" or "collar," which is indeed thicker and more prominent than on other canids like foxes or wolves. This mane helps protect the neck from bites during fights and provides insulation. The dhole in the image has reddish-brown fur, a slender build, and pointed ears, all typical features of this species.

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of small size in the dog category. 
 description: The dog in the picture appears to be small in size, which is characteristic of many breeds known for their diminutive stature. Here are some visual attributes that contribute to identifying this as a small-sized dog:

1. **Compact Build**: The dog's body is relatively short and not bulky, indicating a smaller frame.
2. **Short Legs**: Although the legs are mostly obscured by fur, the visible portion suggests they are short compared to larger breeds.
3. **Small Face Proportions**: The face is proportionally large relative to its body, with a broad forehead and expressive eyes that give it a cute and endearing look.
4. **Fur Texture and Length**: The fur is fluffy and long, covering much of the body, which can sometimes make them appear even smaller due to the way light reflects off the thick coat.
5. **Proportionate Head Size to Body Size**: The head is relatively large in proportion to the body, which is often seen in small dogs.

The dog in the image has these characteristics—fluffy, short-haired fur, a compact build, and a head that seems disproportionately large in relation to its body—indicating that it is likely a small-sized breed.

 description: The dog in the picture has thick, black fur that appears to be wet, likely from swimming or being in water. The fur looks matted and clumped together due to moisture, giving it a shiny, glossy appearance. The texture is rough and uneven, with individual strands of hair sticking out in various directions. The wetness causes the fur to lack crisp edges, resulting in a more rounded and slightly disheveled look. The dog's eyes appear bright and reflective, which can sometimes enhance the perception of shine on the fur. Additionally, the dog's tongue is hanging out, suggesting it might have been playing or cooling off in water.
