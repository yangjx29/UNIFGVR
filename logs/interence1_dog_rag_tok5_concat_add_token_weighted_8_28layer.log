Otherwise, there might be something wrong with your environment. Did you have `libjpeg` or `libpng` installed before building `torchvision` from source?
  warn(
Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.

The image processor of type `Qwen2VLImageProcessor` is now loaded as a fast processor by default, even if the model checkpoint was saved with a slow processor. This is a breaking change and may produce slightly different outputs. To continue using the slow processor, instantiate this class with `use_fast=False`. Note that this behavior will be extended to all models in a future release.
`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!

prompt: Given an image, describe the visual attributes of black and white fur in the dog category. 
 description: The image shows two dogs with predominantly black and white fur. Here's a description of their visual attributes:

1. **Color Pattern**: The dogs have a classic "black and white" coloration, which is characteristic of Boston Terriers. This pattern typically includes a white blaze down the center of the face, white markings on the chest, and sometimes on the legs and paws.

2. **Fur Texture**: The fur appears short, smooth, and well-groomed, which is typical for Boston Terriers. The texture looks soft and shiny, indicating good health and care.

3. **Ears and Face**: Both dogs have upright ears that stand alert, and their faces display distinct black and white markings. The white fur is primarily on the chest, muzzle, and around the eyes, while the black fur covers most of the head, back, and legs.

4. **Body Shape**: The dogs have a compact, muscular build, with broad shoulders and a short, sturdy body, which is consistent with the Boston Terrier breed.

5. **Posture and Expression**: They appear attentive and curious, with perked-up ears and bright, focused eyes. Their posture suggests they are alert and ready to react to something happening off-camera.

 description: The dog in the image appears to be a standard Schnauzer with a meticulously groomed and styled coat. The grooming style is characterized by:

1. **Neat and Trimmed Fur**: The fur is short and closely trimmed across most of the body, giving it a sleek and uniform appearance.
2. **Well-Defined Legs and Feet**: The fur on the legs is longer but still neatly trimmed, creating a clean line from the knee down to the paw.
3. **Ears and Face Area**: The fur around the face is slightly longer, framing the face, which is a common feature in many dog breeds for aesthetic and practical reasons (to protect the ears and eyes).
4. **Body Coverage**: The body has a mix of shorter and slightly longer fur, which is often referred to as a "salt and pepper" or "wire-haired" texture, typical of the Schnauzer breed.
5. **Tail**: The tail is left long and slightly curled over, adding a distinctive flair to the overall look.

This grooming style is often seen in show dogs where the aim is to present the animal in its best possible condition, highlighting its natural features while maintaining a polished and professional appearance.

Instead, it shows a dog with a thick, curly black coat that appears to be somewhat shaggy and textured rather than smooth and shiny.

If you're referring to a specific breed known for having a short, stubby tail, such as a Pug or a Shih Tzu, this particular dog in the image resembles a Black Russian Terrier (also known as a Kasha), which typically has a thick, dense coat but does not have a short, stubby tail. Instead, they often have a medium-length tail that is carried low and curled over their back. If you're looking for a dog with a short, stubby tail, breeds like the Pug, Shih Tzu, or Bichon Frise would be more fitting examples.
