Otherwise, there might be something wrong with your environment. Did you have `libjpeg` or `libpng` installed before building `torchvision` from source?
  warn(
Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.

The image processor of type `Qwen2VLImageProcessor` is now loaded as a fast processor by default, even if the model checkpoint was saved with a slow processor. This is a breaking change and may produce slightly different outputs. To continue using the slow processor, instantiate this class with `use_fast=False`. Note that this behavior will be extended to all models in a future release.
`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!

1. **Coloration and Markings**: The puppy has a predominantly black coat with tan markings on its face, ears, and legs. This is typical for certain Corgi color variations.

3. **Ears**: The puppy has large, pointed, and upright ears, which are another hallmark of the Corgi breed.

4. **Size and Proportion**: Although the puppy is small, it has proportionate body structure, with a sturdy build and a short, muscular neck—a trait often seen in Corgis.

5. **Expression and Pose**: The puppy looks relaxed and content, lying down on grass with a soft, plush toy partially covering its chest. Its head is slightly tilted, adding to its adorable appearance.
