output_text: ["The image shows a small dog peeking out from inside a purple backpack. The dog appears to be a Chihuahua, characterized by its small size and distinctive facial features, including a black and white coat with a white muzzle and chest area. The dog's head is partially covered by the purple fabric of the backpack, which has a zipper and a handle visible in the background. The dog looks curious or attentive, with its eyes wide open. The background includes part of what seems to be a reflective, metallic object, possibly a mirror or a piece of equipment, adding an interesting contrast to the scene."]
